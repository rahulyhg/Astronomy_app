Overview:
This app creates a main screen consisting of two views: One showing basic
data for the Moon, and the other showing basic data for the Sun. The two 
views are seperate classes, extending the Fragment class created by Google
specifically made to be used as views attatched to XML UI elements. 

Some concepts used were learned during the APCS class year:
	-Basic networking and getting data from webpages
	-Using try/catch structures properly to handle errors
	-Creating arrays of different classes
Concepts that needed to be learned include:
	-Android's ui framework including views and fragments in views, etc
	-Working with images from the internet, and placing them in views
	-Understanding Android structure and how the android system deals 
	with different actions (No networking on main thread, permissions system
	manipulating data in xml files thorugh java, Intent class and system to send
	data between classes, other complicated things)
Instructions to run :
	Unless you have Android Studio and the android emulator, it can't be run.
